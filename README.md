## Room Occupancy
Due to shortage of staff, here we are automating the process of checking room availability.The rooms in the facility are classified occupied or unoccupied based on passive sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light and CO2 levels. The model is based on logical regression for binary classification. 
## Social Distancing Alarm Prompt
With less staff onboard, it gets hetic for the workers to continously keep a check on the social distancing norm being followed in the facility. So, in this track, the task of checking social distancing is being automated. The system will create an alert "!!TOO CLOSE!!" if two individuals dont maintain a certain gap. Futher, it could be connected to a sensor to create alarm system in the facility.
