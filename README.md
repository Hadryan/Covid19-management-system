# Covid19-management-system
## **Problem Statement**
*Due to increase in no. of cases of Covid, it's getting tough for hospital management and other premises to manage proper functionality of staff and patients too which results in failure of system as well as rise in cases.*
## **Solution**
*Our team worked on four tracks which includes:*
1. Covid Analysis
2. Mask Detection
3. Room Occupancy
4. Social Distancing
# Covid Analysis
## Problem: 
When it comes to infectious diseases data collection is difficult at the best of times. The rise of big data has provided clinicians and researchers with the systems and ability to store and work with large amounts of data, but in public health, critical surveillance systems remain slow to collect and difficult to disseminate. 
## Solution:
Real time data acquisition and analysis of high-resolution data tends to focus on mortality and morbidity. Collecting accurate data and understanding the limitations of the data is an essential part of understanding the situation.
