# Covid19-management-system
## **Problem Statement**
*Due to increase in no. of cases of Covid, it's getting tough for hospital management and other premises to manage proper functionality of staff and patients too which results in failure of system as well as rise in cases.*
## **Solution**
*Our team worked on four tracks which includes:*
1. Covid Analysis
2. Mask Detection
3. Room Occupancy
4. Social Distancing
# Covid Analysis
## Problem: 
When it comes to infectious diseases data collection is difficult at the best of times. The rise of big data has provided clinicians and researchers with the systems and ability to store and work with large amounts of data, but in public health, critical surveillance systems remain slow to collect and difficult to disseminate. 
## Solution:
Real time data acquisition and analysis of high-resolution data tends to focus on mortality and morbidity. Collecting accurate data and understanding the limitations of the data is an essential part of understanding the situation.

### Project Tasks :
1. Data Collection and Interpretation
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Modeling and Prediction
4. Data Communication
5. Data Visualisation
### Project Outcomes:
* Infographics and Data Visualisation puts raw numbers into perspective
* Interactive and continually updated information of each state
* Continual monitoring of Cases draw from latest data
             
             
 # Room Occupancy
## Problem:
During covid times, maintaining social distancing is necessary, whether it be rooms for patients or washrooms. But it's not possible to tell if a room is just used or not, which makes the next user or cleaner vulnerable to unhealthy circumstances.


## Solution:
Here, we are automating the process of checking room availability. The rooms in the facility are classified occupied or unoccupied based on passive sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light and CO2 levels. The model is based on logical regression for binary classification. 

### Project Tasks:
1. Data Collection and Interpretation
2. Data Modeling and Prediction
3. Data Visualisation
4. Data Classification
5. Prediction Modelâ€™s accuracy

### Project Outcomes
* Effective utilisation of the available  space i.e avoiding re-usage of the same room/restroom
